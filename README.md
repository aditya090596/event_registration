# event_registration
This project provides a simple event registration platform where users can register for an event by submitting their details through a web form. The data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, and users receive an email confirmation via Amazon SES. The frontend communicates with the backend through Amazon API Gateway, which integrates with AWS Lambda.
